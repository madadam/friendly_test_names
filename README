Friendly test names
===================

What is it?
-----------

This tiny extension for test/unit allows you to write this:

  class LolCatTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    test 'can haz cheeseburger' do
      assert @lolcat.can_haz_cheeseburger?
    end
  end

instead of this:

  class LoLCatTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_can_haz_cheeseburger do
      assert @lolcat.can_haz_cheeseburger?
    end
  end

Nothing more, nothing less.


How to use it?
--------------

Just require "friendly_test_names" in your test. Done.


But <insert your favorite test tool> does this plus much more!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, but I don't want much more. I don't want contexts, fancy macros or
rspec-esque pseudo plain language DSL. I want just friendly test name, nothing
more.
